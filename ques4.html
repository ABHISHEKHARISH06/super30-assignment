    <h1>Dear Grandma's Guide to the Box Model</h1>
    
    <div class="grandmas-box">
        This is your special box, Grandma!<br>
        (Like a cake on a plate)
    </div>
    
    <div class="explanation">
        <h2>How to Understand This "Box Model" Thing</h2>
        <p>Imagine you're serving cake at bridge club:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The Cake (Content)</strong>: The actual cake itself - that's your words or pictures inside the box.</li>
            <li><strong>Frosting (Padding)</strong>: The yummy layer around the cake that keeps it from touching the plate edges.</li>
            <li><strong>Cake Plate Rim (Border)</strong>: The decorative edge of the plate that holds everything.</li>
            <li><strong>Table Space (Margin)</strong>: The empty space around the plate so other desserts don't crowd it.</li>
            <li><strong>Cake Flavor (Background)</strong>: The actual color/flavor of the cake underneath everything.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When you change these values, it's like changing how much frosting you use, what plate you put it on, or how much space you leave on the table!</p>
